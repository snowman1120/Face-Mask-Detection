# Face-Mask-Detection
In this, I am attaching my code for building a CNN model to detect if a person is wearing face mask or not using the webcam of their PC using TensorFlow, keras library and OpenCV.

I have used the face mask dataset provided by [Prajna Bhandary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6655711815361761280/)
